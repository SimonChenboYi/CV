I'm an enthusiastic and energetic Software Engineer at Makers and a former Project Manager with a Ph.D degree in Environmental Engineering. I have managed multiple projects in both the engineering and education sectors. I would like to use my strengths in research and analytical thinking to make better, more technical contributions to projects. During my time at Makers, I discovered my passion for programming and self-directed learning. I am now looking for an opportunity to join a fast-paced software team to deliver exciting projects/products in a team I can learn from and contribute to.


## Projects

Examples:

Project title | Description | Project Timeframe | Technologies | Testing
------------- | ------------------------------  | ------------- |------------- |---------
[Dinnergy](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/dinnergy)| Dinnergy is an iPhone application that allows users to plan a meal depending on their available ingredients. In two weeks, we learned Swift and Xcode to support the development and used XCTest to test-drive our units and features. In this project, I led the Backend development including the Database, Business Logic and TDD. | 10 days (Team of Six) | Swift , SQLite, Xcode | Travis, SwiftLint, XCTest
[Ace-Book](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/acebook-MVP): Deployed at: [https://acebook-heroku.herokuapp.com/](https://acebook-heroku.herokuapp.com/) | A clone of Facebook. Together we learned and used Ruby on Rails and CI/CD . We communicated effectively with our 'Clients' to deliver the best product among the 5 groups. I led the tasks on database management, controller logic, deployment, and I made contributions to the other parts of the project. I used my experience in project management by leading the first meetings. | 9 days (Team of Six) | Ruby , Rails, PostgreSQL | Travis, Rspec, Capybara
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/MakersBnB) | A clone of AirBnB. Together we learned a new tech stack including Express.JS, Jasmine for TDD, and Sequelize as our ORM. We also experienced multiple working styles ( team, sub-teams, individual). I shared my experiences in project management and decision-making while managing workflow via Git/Github branches. This helped us to grow collaboratively and significantly in a short space of time .| 4 days-(Team of Four) | Javascript, node.js, express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize | Jasmine, Nightwatch.js
[Bowling-Scorecard](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge) | A single page web app of bowling scorecard. A User can enter the number of pins knocked down for each roll. The score is calculated after each round and updated when spares or strikes | 2 days-(Solo) | Javascript, JQuery | Jasmine
[Chitter](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/chitter) | A web app of a message board. A User can sign up, log in and post a message similar to a tweet on Twitter. The message owner and time of post are listed next to the message on the board. | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara
[Rock_Paper_Scissors](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/rps-challenge)| A web application to play ‘Rock Paper Scissors’ with another player or against the computer. When playing against the computer, the computer will select a random movement. | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra | RSpec, Capybara



## Skills



#### Communication



At Makers, I pair-programmed daily and led the stand-up meeting in my group projects. I am flexible and able to modify my process to align with the team (Link:[Feedbacks from Paring Partners and Project Teams](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/CV/blob/master/Feedback.md)). As a former project manager, I worked closely with technical teams and advanced my skills in liaising with clients and subcontractors in SMT. At CUDL, I improved my communication with internal teams and stakeholders. The conference manager at Sidney Sussex college used 'efficient' to describe my communication with her.



#### Fast Learning

I can pick up new concepts and skills quickly through self-directed learning and a growth mindset. I have learnt C# and Ruby in 6 weeks before joining Makers. At Makers, I was able to learn JavaScript and Jasmine in 1 week and used what I had learned to achieve a Minimum Viable Product in my projects using Test-Driven-Development. Similarly, I made an AirBnB clone using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize and Nightwatch.js with no prior experience in a week. Besides programming, I demonstrated my learning by quickly picking up concepts on mechanical engineering in the automotive industry and in leading on technical translation. During my PhD research, I was able to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of microwave-heating with no previous knowledge, and furthered my multidisciplinary research as a result.



#### Analytical Thinking

When programming at Makers, I often used analytical skills to solve complicated tasks. I used AGILE methodologies and TDD to break them into smaller ones. I was able to find solutions simply using these techniques ([An example of analysing complicated logic:Bowling-Scorecard](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge); [Another example: Break Ruby Quine into steps](https://medium.com/@ycb0001/my-first-ruby-quine-with-12-steps-207658c43c2b)). I also like analysing others’ code, from which I’ve been able to learn and contribute to easily ([Example: Analysis on Count App](https://medium.com/@ycb0001/learn-code-via-example-code-analysis-be90cfc2b9e)). Before Makers, I had been using my analytical skills and tools on project and task planning, budget control and research.



#### Problem Solving

I have been practising and improving my problem solving skills throughout my education and career. I greatly enjoy the process of problem-solving itself. From [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Simon%20Yi) to the projects in Makers, I have demonstrated an ability to adapt to a variety of methodologies and processes and take multiple perspectives to draw solutions. I regularly helped my cohort to debug their code and unblock themselves in the process. In SMT, one of my tasks was to modify the project plan to align with changes from clients, and in CUDL I solved ad hoc logistics issues or situations raised from clients or suppliers . This was a daily job in winter/summer schools’ term time.

- Full project lifecycle experience
- Bilingual, Fluent in English and Native in Mandarin
