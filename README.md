I'm an enthusiastic and energetic Software Engineer at Makers and a former Project Manager with Ph.D degree in Environmental Engineering. I have managed multiple projects in engineering sector and education sector. Further than a non-technical project manager, I would like to use my strengths on research and analytical thinking to have the deeper contributions on projects. During the self-learning, I discovered the enjoyment of programming and magnified the enjoyment at Makers. I am now looking for an opportunity to join a fast paced software team delivering exciting projects/products where I can learn extensively with and contribute to.

## Projects
Examples:

Project title  | Description  									| Project Timeframe | Technologies | Testing
------------- | ------------------------------	| ------------- |------------- |---------
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/MakersBnB) | A clone of AirBnB in 4 days with 3 other team members. We together learnt  new tech stack  including  framework,   test library, ORM. We also experienced multiple working styles ( team, sub-teams, individual). I have shared my experiences on project management and decision making and learnt the work flow on git/Github. We grew massively and collaboratively.| 4 days-(Team of Four) | Javascript, node.js, express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize | Jasmine, Nightwatch.js
[Bowling-Scorecard](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge) | A single page web app of bowling scorecard. User can enter the number of pins knocked down of each roll. The score is calculated after each round and updated when spares or spikes  | 2 days-(Solo) | Javascript, JQuery | Jasmine
[Chitter](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/chitter) | A web app of message board. User can sign up, login and post message. Message owner and posting time are listed with message on the board.   | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara
[Rock_Paper_Scissors](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/rps-challenge)| A web application for playing Rock_Paper_Scissors between two players or with the computer. When playing with computer,  the computer selects a random movement. | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra  | RSpec, Capybara

## Skills

#### Communication

 At Makers I pair programmed daily and lead the stand up meeting in my group projects. I am flexible and able to modify my process to align with the team. As a former project manager, I worked closed to the technical teams and had opportunity to enrich my experiences on liaison with clients and sub-contractors in SMT. At CUDL, I improved my skills on communication with internal teams and stakeholders. The conference manager at Sidney Sussex college used 'efficient' to describe my communication with her.

#### Fast Learning
 I can pickup new concepts and skills quickly through self-learning. I have learnt C# and ruby in about 6 weeks before joining Makers. At Makers, I was able to learn javascript and jasmine in one week and converted my learning to minimum viable product by TDD. Similarly, I made an AirBnB clone using node.js, express.js, Sequelize and Nightwatch.js with no prior experience in a week. Beside programming, I demonstrated my learning skills by quickly picking up concept on mechanical engineering in automotive industry and in turn lead on technical translation. During the PhD research, I was able to gain solid understanding on physical fundamentals of microwave heating quickly with no previous knowledge and built my multidisciplinary research.       

#### Analytical Thinking
  When programming at Makers, I often used analytical skills to solve complicated tasks. I used agile methodologies and TDD to break them into smaller ones and I was able to find solutions when working toward to them ([An example of analysing complicated logic:Bowling-Scorecard](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge); [Another example: Break Ruby Quine into steps](https://medium.com/@ycb0001/my-first-ruby-quine-with-12-steps-207658c43c2b)). I also like analysing others code, from which I can leant from the code or carry on the work from other team members easily ([Example: Analysis on Count App](https://medium.com/@ycb0001/learn-code-via-example-code-analysis-be90cfc2b9e)). Before Makers, I have been using the analytical skills and tools on project/tasks planning, budget control and research.

#### Problem Solving
  I have been practising and improving my problem solving skill across my education and career. Beside the outcome of solving problem, I also enjoy the process itself. From the [Codewar](https://www.codewars.com/users/Simon%20Yi) to the projects in Makers, I am able to adopt variety of methodologies and processes plus multi-perspective thinking to draw solutions. I often help my cohort to debug their code and unblock the process. In SMT one of my task was to modify the project plan to align with changes from clients，and in CUDL solving ad hoc logistic issues or situations raised from clients or suppliers was daily job in term time of winter/summer schools.

- Bi-linguist, Fluent in English and Native in Mandarin

## Interests
I like solving mathematics problems. Beyond solving them, I enjoy the process of exploring solutions. I was ranked as the 2nd out of about 900 students in mathematics in the China National College(University) Entrance Examination. I also like playing table tennis. I played with my teams during the breaks.
