I'm a enthusiastic and energetic Software Engineer in Makers and a former Project Manager with Ph.D degree in Environmental Engineering. I have managed multiple projects in engineering sector and enducation sector. Further than a non-technical project manager, I  would like to use my strengths on research and analytical thinking to have the deeper contributions on projects. During the self-learning, I discovered the enjoyment of programming and magnified the enjoyment in Makers Academy. I am now looking for an opportunity to join a fast paced software team delivering exciting projects/products where I can learn extensively with and contribute to.

## Projects
Examples:

Project title  | Description  									| Project Timeframe | Technologies | Testing
------------- | ------------------------------	| ------------- |------------- |---------
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/MakersBnB) | A clone of AirBnB in 4 days with 3 other team members. We together learnt  new tech stack  including  framework,  new test library,  ORM. We also experienced multiple working styles ( team, sub-team, individual). I have shared my experiences on project management and decision making and leant the work flow on git/Github. We grew massively and collaboratively.| 4 days-(Team of four) | Javascript, node.js, express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize | Jasmine, Nightwatch.js
[Bowling-Scorecard](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge) | A single page web app of bowling scorecard. User can enter the number of pins knocked down of each roll. The score is calculated after each round and updated when spares or spikes  | 2 days-(Solo) | Javascript, JQuery | Jasmine
[Chitter](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/chitter) | A web app of message board. User can sign up, login and post message. Message owner and posting time are listed with message on the board.   | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara
[Rock_Paper_Scissors](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/rps-challenge)| A web application for playing Rock_Paper_Scissors between two players or with the computer. When playing with computer,  the computer selects a random movement. | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra  | RSpec, Capybara

## Skills

#### Communication

 At Makers I pair programmed daily and lead the stand up meeting in my group projects. I am flexible on working styles and able to modify my process depends on mutual agreement. As a former project manager, I worked closed to the technical teams and had opportunity to enrich my experiences on liaison with clients and sub-contractors in SMT. At CUDL, I improved my skills on communication with internal teams and stakeholders. The conference manager at Sidney Sussex college used 'efficient' to describe my communication with her. Similarly the collaboration of CUDL with ACCA Global HQ initiated after I reached out to their head of International Student Flow and had an 'informative' conference call.

#### Fast Learning
 I can pickup new concepts and skills quickly through self-learning. I have learnt C# and ruby in about 6 weeks before joining Makers. In Makers, I was able to learn javascript and jasmine in one week and converted my learning to minimum viable product by TDD. Similarly, I made a AirBnB clone using  node.js, express.js, Sequelize and Nightwatch.js with no prior experience in a week. Beside programming, I demonstrated my learning skills by quickly picking up concept on mechanical engineering /automotive industry and in turn leading on technical translation. During the PhD research, I was able gain solid understanding on physical fundamentals quickly with no previous knowledge and built my multidisciplinary research.       

#### Analytical Thinking
  When programming in Makers, I often used analytical skills to solve complicated tasks. I used agile methodologies and TDD to break them into smaller ones and I was able to find solution when working toward to it ([An example of breaking complicated logic into smaller ones](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge);[Another example: Break Ruby Quine into steps](https://medium.com/@ycb0001/my-first-ruby-quine-with-12-steps-207658c43c2b)). I also analyse others code, from which I can leant from the code or carry on the work from other team members easily ([Example: Analysis on Count App](https://medium.com/@ycb0001/learn-code-via-example-code-analysis-be90cfc2b9e)). Before joining Makers, I have been using the analytical skills and tools on project/tasks planning, budget control and research.


#### Problem Solving
The years in project environment provide me excellent opportunities to develop my troubleshooting skills. I have used the analytical methods and object oriented thinking to meet project criteria and solve ad hoc situations all the time. To meet the tight timeline in a HEV NVH reduction project, with carefully discussion with my technical team, I initiated the CAE analysis task before the model being finalised but refining the model and analysis with later received rig/vehicle tests data. In CUDL, I used open issues list to analysis the performance and in turn drew and implemented action plans accordingly, by this mean I helped CUDL to maintain the approval by British Accreditation Council.
