I'm a enthusiastic and energetic Software Engineer and a former Project Manager with Ph.D degree in Environmental Engineering. I have managed multiple projects in engineering sector and enducation sector. Further than a non-technical project manager, I  would like to use my strengths on research and analytical thinking to have the deeper contributions on projects. During the self-learning, I discovered the enjoyment of programming and magnified the enjoyment in Makers Academy. I am now looking for an opportunity to join a fast paced software team delivering exciting projects/products where I can learn extensively with and contribute to.

## Projects
Examples:

Project title  | Description  									| Project Timeframe | Technologies | Testing
------------- | ------------------------------	| ------------- |------------- |---------
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/MakersBnB) | A clone of AirBnB in 4 days with 3 other team members. We together learnt  new tech stack  including  framework,  new test library,  ORM. We also experienced multiple working styles ( team, sub-team, individual). I have shared my experiences on project management and decision making and leant the work flow on git/Github. We grew massively and collaboratively.| 4 days | Javascript, node.js, express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize | Jasmine, Nightwatch.js
[Bowling-Scorecard](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/bowling-challenge) | A single page web app of bowling scorecard. User can enter the number of pins knocked down of each roll. The score is calculated after each round and updated when spares or spikes  | 2 days | Javascript, JQuery | Jasmine
[Chitter](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/chitter) | A web app of message board. User can sign up, login and post message. Message owner and posting time are listed with message on the board.   | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara
[Rock_Paper_Scissors](https://github.com/SimonChenboYi/rps-challenge)| A web application for playing Rock_Paper_Scissors between two players or with the computer. When playing with computer,  the computer selects a random movement. | 2 days -(Solo) | Ruby, Sinatra  | RSpec, Capybara



## Skills

#### Communication

Since the university years, I have supervised several technical research projects for year 3 students and master students. At SMT, before hands on projects, I began with translating technical reports and commercial contracts  between English and Mandarin. During projects, beyond project planning, progress control and delivery, I had opportunity to enrich my experiences on liaison with clients and sub-contractors. At CUDL, I had frequent communication with partners colleges, which the conference manager at Sidney Sussex college used 'efficient' to describe my communication with her. Similarly the collaboration of CUDL with ACCA Global HQ initiated after I reached out to their head of International Student Flow and had an 'informative' conference call.


#### Research
I have fast developed my research skills during the Ph.D study. By critical reviewing hundreds journal paper I have not only gained the fundamental knowledge on the multi-disciplinary subject but also determined a sub-research topic with a feasible research plan. I have accordingly designed and built a bench scale and a batch scale experimental platform. Combining the collaboration with the research group on the shared pilot scale platform, my research led to three coauthored three scientific journal paper. I practices these research skills throughout my later jobs, i.e.  formulating summer school courses in a new discipline by information mining and reach out relevant speakers.


#### Analysis
When I performed scientific research, I often used analytical skills to break the complex problem and concept into small ones by adopting some mathematic tools I can draw intermediate conclusions and in turn formulate or refine the next step plans. When I did the budget control for programme in the CUDL, I used excel to weight costs of each item and prioritise the steps of cutting costs. With the analysis skills, I was able to learn new concept fast and transfer between different industries.         



#### Troubleshooting
The years in project environment provide me excellent opportunities to develop my troubleshooting skills. I have used the analytical methods and object oriented thinking to meet project criteria and solve ad hoc situations all the time. To meet the tight timeline in a HEV NVH reduction project, with carefully discussion with my technical team, I initiated the CAE analysis task before the model being finalised but refining the model and analysis with later received rig/vehicle tests data. In CUDL, I used open issues list to analysis the performance and in turn drew and implemented action plans accordingly, by this mean I helped CUDL to maintain the approval by British Accreditation Council.

## Interests
I am a big fan of playing ping pong and played quite often back in student age. I like road trips which further than appreciating the destinations I can also enjoy the tour themselves.
