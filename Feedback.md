*Paring on week challenge:*

**Stuart Pethurst:**
Simon has a great understanding of ruby and I found working with him a pleasure as it was helpful to confirm the ideas about the code we were trying to write and we worked well as a team both driving and navigating

**Tara Sankhalpara:**
-Simon was excellent in both navigator and driver roles. I liked how we swapped roles on each step and it was clear what each of us were doing.
-Simon was very helpful to explain rspec errors and the logic/meaning behind them.
-It was great that on each step he would try out new tests different to the examples given and try changing the code for different scenarios.
-The pairing session was very enjoyable and I learnt a lot from the session

**Xian Storey:**
Chenbo was great to pair with. He quickly understood complex problems and talked them through with me before writing any code, and used visual notes to explain things I couldn’t understand. It was easy to solve issues with this approach and Chenbo made sure to feature and unit test every step of the way to ensure we had strong code.

**Jose Quinones:**
Simon I enjoyed pairing with you. I could see that you have a good understanding of TDD and you were able to explain the little details to me in a clear way. When answering the challenge theoretical questions you were able to take your time to produce a clear and thoroughly answer. Really looking forward to work with you again!

*Group Projects:*

**Dominic White:**
Simon - I really enjoyed working with Simon during our week 6 group project. Simon is incredibly knowledgeable and has plenty of patience to help his team mates understand a concept or by justifying the way he works by breaking it down to others. After working with Ollie through the afternoon, Simon was then able to communicate to Jose and I exactly what they had completed, e.g when they created the databases. With the help of Simon this week I was able to keep track of the stages we were going through whilst building the project. Having Simon in our group was been nothing but beneficial! He is very dedicated to ‘getting the job done’, and great at explaining things! He has a great way of learning, being able to resource relevant information quickly and effectively, and is patient when confronted with a difficult part of building a program, a great skill to have which reflects his development in areas such as being able to program fluently and writing code that is easy to change and easy for others to understand. Simon takes his work very seriously, something I admire, and can genuinely see that he enjoys programming! I’ve learnt a lot from Simon in our knowledge sharing sessions/team retrospectives and general discussions, he is a great teammate. He put in a lot of extra work into our project, coding after hours on his own time, in order to help the team succeed. I really hope and look forward to working with Simon again in the future.


**Sejin Kim:**
Working with Simon for past 2 weeks for the Acebook project was a joy.
His methodical approach helped the team when we were stuck.
When there is a problem, he knows how to tighten the loop and find the right solution.
He cares about what makes a good code - tries his best to refactor and keep the codes clean.
Simon is not only a good communicator but also a patient pair-partner and a teacher.
When his pair is struggling to understand certain code, he follows the steps together and explains how those works.
I had great help with how to plan a database and how routes work on Rails from Simon.
I appreciate his dedication and hard work for the team and I look forward to working with him again in the future.
It was lovely working together Simon, I don’t think we were able to progress this far without your help.

Simon was a great person to pair with for our Acebook engineering project. What stood out most was his confidence when tackling problems he had not encountered before, a calm logical approach that always resulted in success.
It is evident to me that Simon has a genuine passion for science, computer programming and solving problems with likeminded people, it is something he naturally gravitates towards. This rubbed off on me and I would jump at the opportunity to work with him again. It felt like we were having fun, and our joint output was impressive.

Simon had no problem stepping up to manage the project, and did so diplomatically. He was also keen to address the balance by allowing others the opportunity to do the same. He communicated clearly throughout the project and diagrammed a lot of complicated principles for the benefit of the team. He has many years’ professional experience in project management, and it shows.

There is no doubt, in my mind, that Simon is one of the most proficient programmers on our cohort. This is a result of discipline, curiosity and the enjoyment he gets from engineering.
